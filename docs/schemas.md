# Schema Definitions and Payloads

Schemas are the core mechanism for defining the structure and validation rules for attestations in the Soroban Attestation Service (SAS). 

## Schema Registry
The Schema Registry smart contract acts as the source of truth for all valid schema types. When an issuer creates an attestation, the SAS contract verifies the schema against the registry.

## Schema Structure
A schema is stored as a comma-separated list of `name Type` field definitions.
Each field must name the attribute and its Soroban type, for example:

```text
first_name String, last_name String, document_id Bytes
```

This keeps the on-chain representation compact while still giving the
contracts and CLI enough structure to reject malformed inputs.

### Creating a Schema
When registering a schema, the caller provides a deterministic UID and the
schema string above. The validator rejects whitespace-only values, entries
without at least one `name Type` pair, and strings that do not resemble a
field declaration.

## Verification
When verifying an attestation off-chain or on-chain, the client decodes the raw `data` field using the associated schema definition. The schema enforces that every issued attestation strictly conforms to the expected layout.
